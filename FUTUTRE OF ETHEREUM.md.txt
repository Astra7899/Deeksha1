FUTUTRE OF ETHEREUM 

Ethereum has a potential of opening up the world of decentralized apps even for people without any technical background. If this happens, it can become a revolutionary leap
for Blockchain technology that will bring it closer to mass-adoption. Most importantly, users can write, manage and deploy smart contracts.The Ethereum platform has the potential 
of profoundly disrupting hundreds of industries that currently depend on centralized control, such as insurance, finance, real estate and so on. 
Currently, the platform is being used to create decentralized apps for a broad range of services and industries. 

Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, is being very careful and modest with his predictions. In a recent interview, he stated that he intends to keep Ethereum the leading 
Blockchain-related platform, focusing on technical issues and security improvement in the new future. Balaji Srinivasan, a CEO of 21.co, has recently voiced his firm belief in 
Ethereum still being around in five to 10 years time. Peter Smith, founder of Blockchain, described Ethereum’s infrastructure applications as ‘fascinating’ and mentioned that 
the platform has a very strong shot at overhauling title insurance, which involves policies related to real estate, as just one example.

Overall, opinions on the future of Ethereum among cryptocurrency experts are generally positive. In the near future, the concept of “private” versus “public” blockchain networks 
might well become a historical footnote, as John Wolpert often opines. Enterprise solutions will maintain private transactions, yet work together to build shared, secure, and 
future-proofed IT infrastructure, rather than each enterprise duplicating and reduplicating infrastructure for its own use cases. Shared infrastructure will free up innovation and 
unlock assets that were previously frozen between siloed organizations.
