FUTUTRE OF DAPPs

A decentralized application is a computer application that runs on a distributed computing system. DApps have been popularized by distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as 
the Ethereum Blockchain, where DApps are often referred to as smart contracts. DApps are typically open source, decentralized, incentivized through providing tokens to those
who validate the DApp, and in compliance with a specific protocol agreed upon within the community.

Decentralized applicationsâ€™ key advantage is the distribution of essential components, a move that improves fault tolerance and makes it practically impossible and expensive to attack
such a network. The backbone of Dapps-blockchain-ensures fast, reliable and secure applications to enhance the customer experience. With increased volume as well as velocity of 
data from new sources like IoT and social media, blockchain and Dapps provide a fast, efficient and affordable way of processing storing big data. Additionally, decentralization acts a 
barrier to collusion, a move that has often allowed corporations and governments to exploit others.

Decentralized apps remain a space to watch for key disruptions in the technology industry. With all the advantages that they present to businesses, dApp Builder makes it much easier
to create Dapps that would enhance business operation.
